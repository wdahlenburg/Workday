Dear Workday, 

I was filling out an application for a job and needed to do a password reset. I came across an information leak on your site. 

When filling out a password reset the site should make no indication to whether this account exists or not. This is because it gives an attacker knowledge about who registered for a job.

For example I can take a database of all students in Purdue and try a password reset with their email. 

If the email is not valid I get: Failed to initiate password reset, please contact administrator

This lets me know who has not applied for a job. 

The contrary is: An email with reset instructions has been sent

This lets me know who has applied for a job. 

Any competing company could abuse this feature to advertise or offer jobs to applicants. 

I would be happy to write up a PoC to demonstrate this flaw. 

My recommendation to mitigate this vulnerability would be regardless of if the user exists you should encourage users to check their email for a password reset.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Regards,
